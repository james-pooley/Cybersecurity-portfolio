# Manage Supply Chain Risk

## Project Overview 
This project focused on assessing and mitigating risks within the PeoplePro Suite, a third-party software solution under consideration by Monistax. 
The assessment identified critical vulnerabilities and compliance gaps, offering recommendations to secure the supply chain and align with Monistax’s stringent security policies.

## Key Objectives 
1. <strong>Conduct a risk assessment </strong> to evaluate operational risks and vulnerabilities within the software.
2. <strong>Identify compliance gaps</strong> between the PeoplePro Suite and Monistax’s security requirements.
3. <strong>Provide actionable recommendations</strong> to mitigate risks and improve the software’s security posture.

## Risk Assessment Summary 
### Key Identified Risks
1. <strong>Phishing Attacks:</strong> Credential theft leading to unauthorised system access.
2. <strong>SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:</strong> Exploitable flaws unauthorised  database access.
3. <strong>Outdataed Software:</strong> Unpatched systems susceptible to exploitation.
4. <strong>Weak Encryption:</strong> Insufficient data protection mechanisms.
5. <strong>Insider Threats:</strong> Legitimate access misused for malicious purposes.

### High-Risk Scenarios

- <strong></strong>
- <strong>Financial Fraud:</strong> Credential theft leading to unauthorised system access.
- <strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Leakage of sensitive payment and personal infomation.
- <strong>Incident Response Delays:</strong> Prolonged system exploitation due to slow response.

## Deliverables
### 1. Risk Assessment Report
A comprehensive evaluation of risks, including:
- <strong>Likelihood and Impact Analysis:</strong> Quantifying risk severity to prioritise remediation.
- <strong>Compliance Assessment:</strong> Identifying gaps between Monistax policies and software security.

### 2. Recommendations
Immediate measures such as:
- Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Strengthening encryption practices (AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.2+ for transit).
- Enhancing incident response planning.

Mid-to-long-term actions including:
- Regular vulnerability scans.
- API security audits.
- Segmentation of network infrastructure to prevent lateral movement.
