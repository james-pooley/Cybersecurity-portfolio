# Set Up Your Cybersecurity Watch

## Project Overview

This project involved creating a tailored cybersecurity watch process to enhance the security posture of a company's technologies and infrastructure. By monitoring relevant cybersecurity news, identifying high-impact vulnerabilities, and understanding updated standards, the project delivered an actionable weekly report to prioritise and mitigate risks effectively.

## Key Objectives

1. Develop a cybersecurity watch to monitor threats and standards.
2. Curate and analyse critical information specific to the companyâ€™s technologies.
3. Deliver a weekly report with insights and actionable recommendations for the security team.
4. Adapt to emerging threats by integrating relevant news and updated policies.

## Technologies and Scope
### The cybersecurity watch focused on:

- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Active Directory Domain Services
- MOVEit File Transfer

## Deliverables 
### Weekly report 

- <strong>Threat Analysis:</strong>. Insights on vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-38063 (Windows) and CVE-2024-5806 (MOVEit).
- <strong>Cyberattack Summaries:</strong> Case studies on real-world attacks affecting similar technologies.
- <strong>Standards Updates:</strong> Updates on NIS2 Directive, UK Cyber Security and Resilience (CSR) Bill, and NIST Framework 2.0.
- <strong>Recommendations:</strong> Mitigation strategies for vulnerabilities and compliance guidance.

### Analysis 

Detailed exploration of: 
- High impact vulnerabilities
- Emerging attack patterns relevant to the organisation's sector
- New regulations shaping cybersecurity policies globally
